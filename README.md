# CNC Lathe Control Program (CS50 Final Project)

This project is a rule-based control program for a CNC lathe (Fanuc),
developed as the final project for Harvard University's CS50x.

## Problem
CNC machining requires precise, deterministic logic to translate
human decisions and manufacturing constraints into machine-executable instructions.

## Solution
I designed and implemented a control program that:
- Encodes machining rules into structured logic
- Prevents common operational errors
- Ensures reliability and repeatability of the machining process

## Skills Demonstrated
- Programming in C / Python
- Rule-based system design
- Translating real-world constraints into deterministic logic
- Cyber-physical systems thinking

## Context
This project reflects my interest in systems design,
decision-making tools, and human–machine interaction.
